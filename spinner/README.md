# Spinner
A tool to start simple Liferay DXP installations on MariaDB.

## Requirements

### liferay-lxc repository cloned
Clone the liferay-lxc repository to a directory. If it's in the same parent as liferay-docker, you don't need to change configuration. If you have it in a different folder, please set the SPINNER_LIFERAY_LXC_REPOSITORY_DIR environment variable to point to that directory.

## How to run
Run ```build.sh -h``` for usage.
